            On the first day, I met my fellow classmates, TAs, and was
            introduced to html. Even though the zoom lesson was a little fast
            paced (understandable for a first day), it was very engaging. During
            the breakout sessions within the lesson, I got to meet some of my
            peers and interact with them on a personal level, which was fun.
            After the html lesson was over, I started the creation of my own
            website, but so far it's not that visually appealing haha

            On the second day, I worked on making my website more appealing by
            using CSS. In the beginning, I was figuring out how flexbox worked,
            but eventually I got the hang of it with the help of my TAs. For the
            breakout sessions, I bonded with my peers and TAs. It was nice to
            talk to one of the TAs about college stuff, since they were very
            informative. We also learned about each other's names through a
            sisterhood activity, and this allowed me to get to know my
            classmates on a deper level. Overall, the day went well and I'm
            excited for the Project Showcase and guest speakers tomorrow!

            Today, we shared our websites with others and explored JavaScript.
            This language allows us to add interactivity to the elements that
            come from HTML and CSS. HTML is basically the skeleton of the
            webpage, CSS is the styling of that skeleton, while JavaScript lets
            the user interact with the elements. After the lesson, we listened
            to our partner speaker, BlackRock, and learned about their efforts
            in sustainability. For today's work, we're creating our own
            personality quiz, so let's see how that goes!

            Today, we learned about the different events in Javascript. I added
            on to my personality quiz using Event Listeners in order to make my
            quiz more interactive. The DOM(Document Object Model) allows you to
            write code that interacts with the HTML page that loads in your
            browser. Basically, We also defined what functions and conditionals
            are in terms of computer science. For our sisterhood activity, we
            created our own poems, and I learned so much about my peers as we
            each shared what we wrote. It turns out, we have so much more in
            common than we think! The last thing I did today was embedding my
            personality quiz project onto my website. I would say that it was a
            success, but of course, there's lot of improvements to be made.

            Today was on the "chiller" side. We shared our personality quizzes
            with each other, and gave back productive feedback. We also
            discussed plans for the second week, and learned about our future
            project! I'm excited to use my newfound skills in order to raise
            awareness to a topic of my choice through the use of a website.

            We're now in week two! Today we reviewed javacript concepts,
            including the use of flexbox. Then, we discussed the goals and
            requirements for our advocacy website. In terms of an effective
            website, it should have a clear way for others to learn about the
            cause, it should be easy to navigate, and have a short
            title/description that others can understand quickly. We also
            analyzed the design and messaging of existing activist websites.

            Today is my last day in this program. We have done so much in these
            two weeks and now I'm going to present my website to others. I
            created an informational website focused on LGBTQ+ issues. I was
            inspired to choose this topic because I wanted to educate people on
            the issues that this community faces on a daily basis. I wanted to
            create a place where people with unsavory beliefs could learn about
            what they might not understand. I've learned how to disect my ideas
            and how to interact with the computer to turn my ideas into reality.
            I didn't realize how impactful this program would be on me. I came
            into this with no expectations, and was pleasantly surprised when I
            was greeted with the most supportive group of girls with a common
            goal of changing the world. There were girls from so many different
            backgrounds, and I loved learning about how much we all actually had
            in common. In this program, I got to know their personalities
            outside of just being coders, and we all got along so well. I wish I
            could have met them in person, but I hope these connections will
            last a lifetime.I wish I found out about this program sooner, but
            I'm so glad I did it!
