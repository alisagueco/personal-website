        <p class="blog-content">
          On the first day, I met my fellow classmates, TAs, and was
          introduced to html. Even though the zoom lesson was a little fast paced (understandable for a first day), it was very engaging. During the breakout sessions within the lesson, I got to meet some of my peers and interact with them on a personal level, which was fun. After the html lesson was over, I started the creation of my own website, but so
          far it's not that visually appealing haha

          On the second day, I worked on making my website more appealing by
          using CSS. In the beginning, I was figuring out how flexbox worked, but eventually I got the hang of it with the help of my TAs. For the breakout sessions, I bonded with my peers and TAs. It was nice to talk to one of the TAs about college stuff, since they were very informative. We also learned about each other's names through a sisterhood activity, and this allowed me to get to know my classmates on a deper level. Overall, the day went well and I'm excited for the Project Showcase and guest speakers tomorrow!
